# Metadata
Metadata is data about data, not the actual content of original data. This could include dates, camera information, GPS location, comments, etc... For music file types it could include, the title, author, track number, and album.

[Exiftool](https://exiftool.org/) is extremely valuable while sifting through different file formats.

With enough metadata, you can start to create digital footprints on targets without needing the actual content of the data.

# Network
Network forensics relates to the monitoring and analysis of computer network traffic for the purpose of information gathering, legal evidence, or intrusion detection. Network investigations deal with volatile and dynamic information.

# Steganography
Steganography is the practice of hiding data in plain sight. This is often embedded in images or audio.

Examples of steganography in digital messages: Concealing messages within the lowest bits of noisy images or sound files, concealing data within encrypted data or within random data, chaffing and winnowing, including data in ignored sections of a file, and the list goes on...
